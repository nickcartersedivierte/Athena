      <h2>When equality becomes a competitive advantage</h2>
      <h5>Benefits for companies bridging the Gender Gap, Apr 26, 2021</h5>
       <img src="../img/equality.jpg" class="card-img-top img"  alt="image">
      <p>According to the MIT article “Closing the Gender Gap is Good for Business” (Cohen, Carol & Ready, Douglas A. 2019) 
	    there is increased research showing that incorporating more women in leadership positions is bound to companies future success. 
		Gender parity has the potential to become a competitive advantage for organizations, as it would help them stay relevant and 
		avoid public criticism (as publicity over gender issues arise) and lack of customer reliability. </br>
		Also, Schooley, Skyle (2019) in an article for businessdaily.com mentions that according to an Atlassian survey 
		about diversity and inclusion, 80% of those who participated believe that working in an inclusive, 
		diverse environment is important in order for the workplace to be successful, 
		<b>as studies show diversity and inclusion improve employee engagement and retention, increases market share 
		and improves financial returns. </b> </br>
		
		<b>According to numerous studies advancing women equality and opportunities for advancement in leadership positions 
		can boost the global GDP, a finding that was also divulged by the McKinsey Global Institute 
		and the International Labour Organization </b>.

		Patty McCord, chief talent officer at Netflix, declared to MIT:
		“We did all kinds of studies at Netflix on achieving extraordinary performance, 
		and one thing we all learned was that diverse teams perform better and produce better outcomes for customers. 
		Yet now, I speak to leaders from companies around the world and they often tell me that their gender deficit 
		at the leadership level is due to a pipeline problem — that they just can’t find [women leaders]. 
		My response is: Really? Have you actually paid attention to the women working alongside you and 
		sitting right in front of you?” (Cohen, Carol & Ready, Douglas A. 2019) .

		Hafner-Cai, Junwei (2020) mentions in an interview for Robeco, a company that invests in emerging markets since 1930, 
		that <b>companies that invest in gender parity “have access to larger talent pool, can retain top performers more effectively 
		and benefit from a better customer understanding as well as better insights into market opportunities” </b>
        </br>
		The company TSG found that by working towards gender equality in their own company, 
		<b>they saw returns of 50%, this represents more than double the amount of the industry average (50% of their employees are women)</b>. 
		Women make 80% of the purchasing decisions in the household, and according to Esserman in an interview 
		for The New York Times, founder of TSG, it was important to start bringing female voices to the table 
		and to leadership positions within the company. (Picker, Leslie 2015)
